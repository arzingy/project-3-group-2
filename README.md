Beneath the surface of the sea lies a hidden archive of human history—sunken ships, each with its own story. Using data from the UK Admiralty’s extensive maritime records, we’ve analyzed over 94,000 shipwrecks and submerged objects to explore the depths of our past.

This project offers a window into what lies beneath, combining historical data with visual insights. We’re diving deep to uncover:
- :earth_africa: Interactive maps pinpointing wreck locations
- :straight_ruler: Depth analysis of where these vessels rest
- :anchor: Causes of wreckage across time and region
- :ocean: Weather conditions at the time of sinking (Potentially)
- :hole: The deepest shipwreck ever recorded
- :passenger_ship: Famous wrecks that captured global attention

  Join us as we navigate the submerged world of maritime history, one wreck at a time.
